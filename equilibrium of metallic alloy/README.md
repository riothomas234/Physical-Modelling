The Bragg-Williams model

In many materials, such as metal alloys, there is a transition between two phases in which the atoms are ordered or disordered over sites within the crystal. The potential energy prefers the ordered state, but the entropy prefers the disordered state. The contributions to the overall energy from the potential energy and the entropy can be written in terms of what is called a free energy, given the symbol  𝐹 , and the state of order can be characterised by a quantity called the order parameter,  𝑄 , whose value varies between  𝑄=1  for fully ordered and  𝑄=0  for completely disordered. One early attempt to develop a theory for this type of phase transition, now known as the Bragg-Williams model, led to the following expression for the free energy:

$𝐹=−𝑇𝑐𝑄2+𝑇[(1+𝑄)ln(1+𝑄)+(1−𝑄)ln(1−𝑄)]$

where  𝑇  is the temperature, and the parameter  𝑇𝑐  turns out to be the temperature of the phase transition. The equilibrium value of  𝑄  at any temperature is that for which  𝐹  is a minimum.
